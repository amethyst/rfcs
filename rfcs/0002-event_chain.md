<details>
<summary>Discuss previous attempts, both good and bad, and how they relate to this proposal.</summary>
The currently EventRetrigger type in Amethyst was the first proof of concept we did at implementing event chains.
We only used it in the UI crate to get a basic idea of how this can work.

After this, I implemented an example UiDriver in a [fork](https://github.com/jojolepro/amethyst/tree/eventchain) and it worked just fine.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions
<details>
<summary>Additional questions to consider</summary>
The main unresolved question that remains is how we will make
the Systems/Drivers register to the EventChannels.

We have the possibility of doing it automatically in a SystemDesc,
but this doesn't work with Pausable Systems.
